This library contains basic tools needed for image processing operations. It also contains the option to resize images in an intelligent (i.e. content-aware) way. To build the library, open the terminal in this directory and:
(0) mkdir build (if it's not already present)
(1) cd build
(2) cmake .. && make
The static library will be created in the lib directory.
