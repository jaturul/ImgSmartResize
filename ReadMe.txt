This directory contains elements of the content-aware resizing application.There are 2 shared libraries - "ImageProcessing" that allows for resizing itself and a couple of other operations and "lodepng", a third party library that allows to encode and decode image files. The third directory, "ImgSmartResizeShowcase" contains an application that uses the libraries to resize provided images using seam carving. 

Now, both "ImageProcessing" and "lodepng" have been pre-built and put into "lib" and "thirdparty/lodepng/lib" directories respectively. Additionally, their headers have been copied into "include" and "thirdparty/lodepng/include" respectively. Thanks to this, it should be enough to build and make only the "ImgSmartResizeShowcase" project. However, those libraries can be built from scratch - instructions on how to do that are contained in the "ReadMe" files of their projects and information on how to transfer those files to the "Showcase" project are contained in the "ReadMe" file of its directory.
